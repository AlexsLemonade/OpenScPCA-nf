# Workflow to simulate single cell data

This workflow is designed to simulate single cell data, primarily using the [splatter](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/splatter.html) package.

Scripts are derived from the the `simulate-sce` module of the [OpenScPCA-analysis](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis) repository.
