This module performs doublet detection on processed SCE objects with [`scDblFinder`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scDblFinder.html).

Scripts are derived from the the `doublet-detection` module of the [OpenScPCA-analysis](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis) repository.
